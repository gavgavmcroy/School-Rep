//------First Choice------
Im sitting here by the campfire when suddenly I hear a distinct crack.
The sound of trees snapping and breaking by the 100s. The ground begins to 
shake. In the far distance I spot hundreds of tanks coming directly towards me
There here to finish off survivors. Theres a tree that looks climable. 
Could get a quick escape but ill be visible. There is alot of debri around
me I could cover up and ride it out. What should I do?

1. Climb a tree and hide
2. Bury myself with surrounding debris
