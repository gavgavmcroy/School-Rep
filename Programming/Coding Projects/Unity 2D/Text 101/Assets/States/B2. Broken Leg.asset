  storyText: "---MOTHER OF FUCK! AH, MY LEG. BASTARD RAN RIGHT SMACK OVER MY ANKLE.
    IT'S GONE. Oh fuck. I think they stopped. No way they heard me yell with the deafening
    engines on those tanks. Oh, fuck they did. Guns drawn on me. 10-15 guys. I sense
    the end is here. I have a pistol in my holster could take one of these bastards
    to the grave with me. Or I can comply and see what happens.\r\n\r\nWhat should
    I do?\r\n1. Take these bastards to hell\r\n2. Comply and see what happens. "
