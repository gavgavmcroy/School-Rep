    of the convoy. Germans have me completely surrounded I can't even understand what
    they're saying. I have a pistol in my holster. it might've been my destiny to
    die with my men. I can take it out and bring one or two with me. Or there was
    a purpose for me surviving the ambush. Some deeper meaning for me in my life.
    Maybe my calling?\r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\r\n1. Die in honor with my men as destiny
    wanted\r\n2. Discover my deeper purpose and throw destiny the bird"
